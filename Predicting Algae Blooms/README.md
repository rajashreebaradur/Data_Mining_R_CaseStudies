Problem Description: 

High concentrations of certain harmful algae in rivers constitute a serious ecological problem with a strong impact not only on river lifeforms, but also on water quality.

Objectives:

1. Being able to monitor and perform an early forecast of algae blooms is essential to improving the quality of rivers
2. To provide better understanding of the factors influencing the algae frequencies

Hypothesis:

Predicting the frequency occurrence of several harmful algae in water samples

Data Description:

1. Type of season
2. Size and Speed of the river
3. Maximum pH value
4. Minimum value of Oxygen
5. Mean value of Chloride
6. Mean value of nitrates
7. Mean value of ammonium
8. Mean of orthophosphate
9. Mean of total phosphate
10. Mean of chlorophyll
11. Seven frequency numbers of different harmful algae found in the respective water samples
